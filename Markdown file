## What I have learned about this course
Git is a tool that helps you tracking, collaborating with other people, editing and see the changes and even you can revert back at anytime you want your code in multiple types of languages.
Gitthub is where you will put the Git files in the repositories

### GitHub flow
#### Repositories
> A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
For more info visite this link [Repositories](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiKtOGKr7j7AhVa1jgGHX8OBpsQFnoECBYQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com%2Fen%2Frepositories%2Fcreating-and-managing-repositories%2Fabout-repositories%23%3A~%3Atext%3DA%2520repository%2520contains%2520all%2520of%2Cproject%27s%2520work%2520within%2520the%2520repository.&usg=AOvVaw1A5MgTpqB5FtYvuWsxLwjL)
#### Cloning
> When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
For more info visite this link [Cloning](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixn6-fr7j7AhV0xzgGHZN4A20QFnoECAgQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.github.com%2Fen%2Frepositories%2Fcreating-and-managing-repositories%2Fcloning-a-repository%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWhen%2520you%2520clone%2520a%2520repository%2Cand%2520folder%2520for%2520the%2520project.&usg=AOvVaw1A0BC2W4ipC0YHVzLxQPgS)
#### Committing and pushing
> Basically, git commit "records changes to the repository" while git push "updates remote refs along with associated objects". So the first one is used in connection with your local repository, while the latter one is used to interact with a remote repository.

### GitHub terms to know
#### Repositories
> We have already mentioned in the first point but here we want to add and explain about the Github dashboroad which can help you navigating in different repositories
#### Branches
> Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.

#### Forks
> A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

#### Pull requests
> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

#### Issues
> Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request.

#### Your user profile
> Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had.

#### Using markdown on GitHub
> Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text. We've added some custom functionality to create GitHub Flavored Markdown, used to format prose and code across our site.

## What I am still confused about
Pull request which to let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. You cannot do it in the main branche because it will tell you that there is no other file to compare with so you will have to fork the file or create another branche to do the modification and do the pull request.
